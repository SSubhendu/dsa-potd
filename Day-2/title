title : Good subtrees
credit: geeksforgeeks

You are given a root node of a binary Tree and each node of the binary tree is assigned a value and you are also given an integer k and you have to return the count of Good subtrees of this binary Tree . Good subtree is a subtree such that the number of distinct values in this subtree is less than or equal to k.

Note: Subtree of a node consists of that node and all nodes of the subtrees of left and right child  of that node  if they exist .

Example 1:

Input:

k=2
Output: 4
Explanation:
We can see all leaves 3,4,5 form good subtrees as number of distinct values in subtrees is 1 which is less than k which is given as 2,now  subtree which starts at 2 and has 3 as left node  is also a good subtree because the count of distinct values is 2 which is equal to k so overall 4 good subtrees.
Example 2:

Input:

k=1
Output: 4
Explanation:
we can see all leaves 2,2 form good subtrees as number of distinct values in subtrees is 1 which is equal to k which is given as 1, now  both subtrees which starts at 2 and has 2 as child also forms  a good subtree because count of distinct values is 1 which is equal to k so overall 4 good subtrees.
