To solve this problem, we can traverse the binary tree in a post-order fashion and keep track of the number of distinct values in each subtree. For this, we can use a hash table to count the number of occurrences of each value in the subtree rooted at a particular node. Once we have the counts for the left and right subtrees of a node, we can merge them and count the number of distinct values in the combined subtree. If the count is less than or equal to k, then we can add the subtree to our answer.
